# GridMasonry

_Masonry with an enforced grid_

Forces Masonry to use a grid layout. Assumes all tiles are *roughly* multiples of the same width & height.
Still works with other sizes, but will create gaps until it can establish the next row.

## Initialize

### In JavaScript

``` js
var container = document.querySelector('#container');
var msnry = new GridMasonry( container, {
  // options...
  itemSelector: '.item',
  columnWidth: 200,
  rowHeight: 266
});
```
