Testing Tools
-------------
We have tools set up to automate testing of JavaScript and Python code based on the previous set up tests.  When making an addition to the project (a feature), be sure to include **at least one** test that tests the intended functionality of that peice of code; this way, if a change is made or files cherry-picked from previous commits, we can tell if it breaks the feature.  The tools are:
* JSTestDriver - A google application for running tests of JavaScript code.
* Jasmine - A Javascript testing tool; we don't use Jasmine, but we do write our tests in Jasmine.
